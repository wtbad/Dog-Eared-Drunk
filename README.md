# Dog-Eared-Drunk
No-holds-barred, wine-fueled literary retreat for the bold and book-obsessed. We dog-ear pages, sip strong drinks, and deliver unfiltered takes on plot, prose, and pretension. Whether the book captivates or the wine kicks in, expect raw, no-nonsense critique. Cheers to literature without the snobbery!
